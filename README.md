# My-Amazing-Daily-Planner
Daily planner to assist with a busy schedule. This web app features a calendar with a row to make notes for task or reminders for a standard 9AM - 5PM business day. 

When the user enter the notes in the row, they are able to save their entry and when the page reloads the information will persist. 

The rows are also colour coordinated to show red for a present time, green for a future time and grey for a pst time. 

The following image displays the calendar with the current date and grey row due to the times being in the past.

## What did I learn?
I learn how to incorporate moment.js in a webapp to display time and reflect current past and present time. 

I also learn how to create an html element in javascript by looping through an array. This made it much easier to create multiple rows. 

I then learn to apply states or classes to these created dynamically created rows using if and else statements.
